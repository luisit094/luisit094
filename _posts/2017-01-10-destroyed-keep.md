# Destroyed Tower

Here is a little scene I did attempting to do some organic modeling. My original plane was to add a bunch of edge loops to a fully blocked out keep then extrude with keep faces together on. That ended up being to tricky so i found ease in sculpting the stone and then hand placing them into the scene. The terrain has a normal map of a high poly version and the baking was done in xNormal.
