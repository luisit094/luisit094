# WIP Petebilt 359

This is the non smoothed version of my truck model I'm currently working on. You can see all the little detail from the side markers the the rear trailer locks. My freelance work has been taking up much of my time so I haven't been able to finish this yet. All that's left is to finish adding suppoting edge loops and unwrapping/texturing. I'm having a lot of fun with this project
