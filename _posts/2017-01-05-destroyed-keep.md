# Destroyed Keep

Here is a little scene I did attempting to do some organic modeling. I started with a base box in Maya then subdivided it several times and drew in a couple cracks with the multi-cut tool, beveled it, then moved them inwards. After i grabbed the sculpt on geo took and sculpted in unneveness to the block. The terrain has a normal map of a high poly version. The baking was done in xNormal.
