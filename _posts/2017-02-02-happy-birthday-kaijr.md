# Happy Birthday Kaijr!

Under the mentorship of Ichiro Lambe of Dejobaan Games eight other students and I worked full time to make Happy Birthday Kaijr! The game was present at PAX East, and the Made in MA PAX Party. We will be pitching the game to Adult Swim on May 4th. I was one of the 3d artists for the game making and unwrapping assets ranging from props to fully destructible buildings. (Painting not mine)
