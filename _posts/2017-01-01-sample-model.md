# Modular House

Here's another asset from Happy Birthday Kaijr! It is a low poly house with different modular roofs and a garage (which has it's own roofs) used in our suburban level. I was able to model in tiny details while still keeping the polycount low. Gutters, window sills, siding and the garage door.
