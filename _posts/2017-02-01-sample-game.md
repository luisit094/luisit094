# 1692

A semester long project in which we concepted out several game idea and built upon one of them. 1692 was a culmination of each of the teams ideas. Deep story, unique art style, branching dialug, and eerie music. I as art lead helped maintain the art style and along with the other artist develope and art bible that would be used as refrence for our models. We wanted everythign to have a "sketchy" look by emphasizing cross hatching in the textures.
