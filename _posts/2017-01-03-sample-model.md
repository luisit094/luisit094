# S.S Scream

Here is the ship model i created for our four hour game jam (Download here) [https://luisvalle.itch.io/sonic-energy-navigation-to-defend-nurture-and-unite-distant-extraterrestrial-species]. Total time to model this was about thirty minutes. Modeled two other ships and some space debris also.
