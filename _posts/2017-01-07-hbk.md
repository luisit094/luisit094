# Asset Showcase for Happy Birthday Kai-jr!

I was a full time 3d artist on this project which lasted four months. My role consisted of taking concepts (sometimes going off nothing) and bringing 
those ideas to life in 3d space, unwrapping the model properly and laying out the UV's in a neat manner so that our texture artists 
would be able to perform their job easily. All building models were modeled with destructibility in mind so I pre-chunked out the building within Maya,
set them up in Unity as prefabs allowing our level designer to just drag and drop into the scene. Most assets were modeled with modularity in mind including 
(highway railing, skyscraper, store, trolley, and trolley tracks).
