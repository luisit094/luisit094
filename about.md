here's stuff about me!

Cultured and creative, I speak both Spanish and English fluently, so it allows me to bring in more diversity into projects. Enthusiastic 3D artist who is always ready for a challenge. A go getter and team player who has experience working in fast paced enviornments and posses an organized and adaptable workflow for game assets.

Fun fact: I'm Left handed
