      I've taken on numerous roles in different projects ranging from lead 3D Artist and Lead Level Designer to Audio and Programmer. I've traveled to many countries including Japan, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Dominican Republic. I speak both Spanish and English fluently, so it allows me to bring in more diversity into projects. With these skills I hope to further improve them with help from others in the industry through an internship. I strive to learn as much as I can.
